# NFC Tag Project for Medical Device Inventory

**Description:**  
This project involves creating an NFC tag-based system to manage and maintain an inventory of medical devices in a hospital. The system is designed for use by biomedical technicians, enabling them to scan, record, and manage device information efficiently.

**Project Objective:**  
The primary objective is to develop an NFC tag reading system that can:  
- **Read Tag Data**: Scan and read NFC tags attached to medical devices.  
- **Display Data on a Screen**: Show the scanned data on an integrated display.  
- **Add Comments**: Allow users to add comments or notes via a touchscreen interface.  
- **Save Data**: Store the scanned information and comments on an SD card.  
- **Export Data**: Ensure the data appears in an Excel-compatible format when the SD card is accessed via a computer.

**System Workflow:**  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - The technician scans NFC tags attached to medical devices in various hospital departments (e.g., pediatric, radiology).  
2. **Data Storage**:  
   - Data is recorded and stored in an SD card in a structured format with the following columns:  
     1. **Tag Number**  
     2. **Device ID Number**  
     3. **Timestamp**  
     4. **Comment Area**  
3. **Data Export**:  
   - When the SD card is inserted into a computer, a file is displayed containing the above data in a spreadsheet-compatible format.

**Features:**  
- **NFC Tag Scanning**: Read and interpret data from NFC tags attached to devices.  
- **Touchscreen Integration**: Provide an interface for users to add comments or observations during the inventory process.  
- **Data Logging**: Save all collected data on an SD card for later access.  
- **Excel File Output**: Ensure the data saved on the SD card is in a format compatible with spreadsheet software like Excel.  
- **Real-Time Display**: Show scanned data and user inputs on the integrated display.

**Potential Applications:**  
- Efficient inventory management of hospital equipment.  
- Easy tracking of medical devices across departments.  
- Simplified data export for reporting and record-keeping purposes.
